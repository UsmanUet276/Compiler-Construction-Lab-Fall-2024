# Compiler-Construction-Lab-Fall-2024
This repository contains a compiler developed as part of the Compiler Construction Lab for the Fall 2024 semester. The project involves building a complete compiler, including stages like lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. The repository documents the progress, features, and components of the compiler.
